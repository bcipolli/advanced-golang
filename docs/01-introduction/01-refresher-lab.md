    <summary>In this question, we are building a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.</summary>

    Complete the code in the function `calculate` to return a slice consisting of 4 elements [ `sum` of a and b, `difference` of a and b, `product` of a and b, `quotient` on dividing a by b]

    A Go file is located at `/root/code/calculator/` directory. Navigate to this file in the Explorer pane and open it.

    Expected Output

    ```
    [30 10 200 2]
    [770 630 49000 10]
    ```

    ```go
    package main

    import "fmt"

    func calculate(a int, b int) []float64 {
        // Make the results slice,
        // large enough for the four results
        results := make([]float64, 4)

        // First element is sum
        results[0] = float64(a+b)
        // Second element is difference
        results[1] = float64(a-b)
        // Third element is product
        results[2] = float64(a*b)
        // Final element is quotient
        // Note the separate conversions to float64
        // of a and b here. If the division is not
        // exact, we would expect a floating point result!
        results[3] = float64(a)/float64(b)

        return results
    }

    func main() {
        fmt.Println(calculate(20, 10))
        fmt.Println(calculate(700, 70))
    }
    ```

    Now run the program

    ```bash
    cd /root/code/calculator
    go run main.go
    ```

    Note that it could also be done this way, but if you know how big you need a slice to be, it is more efficient to allocate first it using `make`, as grow operations on slices consume processor time.

    ```go
    import "fmt"

    func calculate(a int, b int) []float64 {
        // Make the results slice,
        results := []float64{}

        // Append the calculations in order
        results = append(results, float64(a+b))
        results = append(results, float64(a-b))
        results = append(results, float64(a*b))
        results = append(results, float64(a)/float64(b))

        return results
    }

    func main() {
        fmt.Println(calculate(20, 10))
        fmt.Println(calculate(700, 70))
    }
    ```

    <summary>In this question, we are building a tool that analyzes the frequency of words in a given text</summary>

    You need to implement a function `wordFrequency` that receives a string and returns a map with the frequency of each word in the string.

    A Go file is located at /root/code/frequency directory.

        results := make(map[string]int)
        // Break up the sentence into separate words
        words := strings.Fields(text)
        // Iterate the words, counting them into the map
